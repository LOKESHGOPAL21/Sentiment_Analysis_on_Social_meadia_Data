# Sentiment Analysis and Visualization of Social Media Data
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. The goal is to extract insights from text data (such as tweets or posts), classify them based on their sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), and provide visualizations to help stakeholders understand trends and patterns.

# Key Features:
Data Collection:

Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the text data by removing noise (e.g., URLs, mentions, special characters).<br>
Sentiment Analysis: 
Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify sentiment.<br>
Visualization:
Create visualizations to depict sentiment trends over time or across different categories (e.g., products, topics).<br>
Insights: 
Summarize insights into public opinion and attitudes toward the analyzed topics or brands.
